# allocation-system
this is a new project。
## usage
#### first：
```
npm install
```
to install the modules
#### second: 
```
npm start of node server,js
```
after this, you can happily code it O(∩_∩)O~~

## Finally
* I write grid system in style.css ， just like bootstrap(.container, .col-md-1.....)
* I use react-router . to see the word in index.js which stays in student folder.
